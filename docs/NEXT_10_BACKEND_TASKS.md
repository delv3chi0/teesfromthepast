# Next 10 Backend Improvement Tasks

## Context

Following the recent configuration initialization hardening and lazy logger implementation (see [CONFIG_INIT_ORDER.md](./CONFIG_INIT_ORDER.md)), the backend infrastructure now has a solid foundation with proper startup sequence validation, fail-fast configuration handling, and safe early imports. This foundation enables us to systematically build upon these reliability improvements with the next phase of backend enhancements.

The configuration system now enforces strict initialization order with `validateConfig()`, `getConfig()`, and `isConfigReady()` APIs, while the logger module supports both early imports and post-validation configuration upgrades. With this groundwork complete, we can focus on observability, security, performance, and operational excellence.

## Task 1: Health & Readiness Endpoints

**Rationale**: With the config validation foundation in place, we need comprehensive health checks to enable proper load balancer integration, deployment orchestration, and operational monitoring. The existing foundation provides the configuration patterns needed for database and external service connection validation.

**Key Actions / Subtasks**:
- Implement `GET /health` liveness endpoint with basic application status
- Implement `GET /ready` readiness endpoint with dependency checks
- Add MongoDB connection health validation using existing config patterns
- Add Redis cache availability check leveraging current cache module
- Add external service health checks (Stripe, Cloudinary, email services)
- Implement response time SLA monitoring (< 50ms for liveness, < 200ms for readiness)
- Add graceful shutdown signal handling

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `GET /health` returns 200 JSON `{status:'ok', uptimeSeconds:number, version:string}` within 50ms under no load
- `GET /ready` returns 200 when all dependencies are healthy, 503 when any critical dependency is unavailable
- Health check responses include timestamp and dependency-specific status details
- Endpoints are excluded from request logging middleware to avoid log noise
- Health checks work correctly before and after `validateConfig()` is called
- Graceful shutdown returns 503 on health checks during shutdown sequence

**Estimated Complexity**: S (Small)  
**Dependencies**: None - builds on existing config and cache infrastructure

**Estimated Complexity**: M (Medium)  
**Dependencies**: Task 1 (health endpoints provide metrics labeling targets)

## Risk Register

### Risk 1: Configuration Complexity Overload
**Impact**: High - Could destabilize the recently hardened config system  
**Probability**: Medium - Multiple tasks add configuration options  
**Mitigation**: 
- Extend existing Zod schema incrementally rather than creating new config files
- Use configuration namespacing to group related settings
- Implement configuration validation tests for each new feature
- Document configuration dependencies clearly

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation from Observability Overhead
**Impact**: Medium - Monitoring could slow down request processing  
**Probability**: Medium - OpenTelemetry and validation add processing overhead  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement sampling for tracing (start with 10% sampling rate)
- Use async processing for non-critical metrics collection
- Add performance budgets and monitoring for middleware overhead
- Provide configuration options to disable features in performance-critical scenarios

### Risk 3: Redis Dependency Single Point of Failure
**Impact**: High - Multiple features depend on Redis availability  
**Probability**: Low - Redis is generally reliable but can fail  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
- Use memory fallbacks for critical caching operations
- Add Redis clustering configuration for production deployments
- Implement Redis health monitoring with automatic failover alerts
- Ensure core application functionality works without Redis
